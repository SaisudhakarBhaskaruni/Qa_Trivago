3. Download the appropriate ChromeDriver from [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).
4. Place ChromeDriver in the system path or specify its location in your script.
5. Import Selenium dependencies in your Java project.
6. Clone this repository and open the project in an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

## How to Run the Script

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile and run the Java file:
